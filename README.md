# SunBEAM-Robot-2
My A-level Fine Art project where a BEAM robot (my remixed version of https://makezine.com/projects/sunbeam-seeker-bot/) follows a contstant IR source to mimic the works of Sun Yuan &amp; Peng Yu "Can't Help Myself" (https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/34812) in a new interpretation. 

Few years down the line I decided to create a better version using skills I had been learning in my engineering degree.
