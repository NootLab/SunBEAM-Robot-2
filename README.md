# SunBEAM-Robot-2
My remixed version of https://makezine.com/projects/sunbeam-seeker-bot/ . [Project Date: 2023]
The main logic of the SunBEAM is to detect the direction with the most infrared light (sunlight) and move toward it.

Key Upgrades in this version:

- custom built pcb
- Recycled LiPo batteries
- larger dc motors
- rear jst hub
- Type-C charging

I originally built a version of this robot at the age of 16. It was my first-ever robot and the project that inspired me to pursue engineering over architecture. After completing my first year of university in 2023, I revisited the project, applying new skills I had gained.

The PDF documents the design history of my efforts to make this robot and an artificial infrared (IR) source on a robot arm. Inspired by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu's artwork "Can't Help Myself" (https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/34812).
