# Over-engineered-SunBEAM-Robot-
My A-level Fine Art "weekend" project where a BEAM robot (my remixed version of https://makezine.com/projects/sunbeam-seeker-bot/) follows a contstant IR source to mimic the works of Sun Yuan &amp; Peng Yu "Can't Help Myself" (https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/34812) in a new interpretation. Few years down the line I decided to create a version 2.
