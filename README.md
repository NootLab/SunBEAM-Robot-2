# SunBEAM-Robot-2
my remixed version of https://makezine.com/projects/sunbeam-seeker-bot/ .
The main logic of the SunBEAM is to detect the direction with the most infrared light (sunlight) and move toward it.

This PDF documents the design history of my efforts to create a robot capable of following a constant infrared (IR) source. The project was inspired by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu's artwork "Can't Help Myself" (https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/34812), reinterpreted through a new lens.

I originally built a version of this robot at the age of 16. It was my first-ever robot and the project that inspired me to pursue engineering over architecture. After completing my first year of university in 2023, I revisited the project, applying new skills I had gained.
